# ProcessScheduler

ProcessScheduler is a versatile tool designed to streamline operations in various industrial domains, including manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and more. It serves as a solution for tackling intricate scheduling challenges that defy straightforward resolutions.

Within this toolkit, you'll find a rich array of features, including:

- **Task Definition**: Define tasks with zero, fixed, or variable durations, along with work_amount specifications.

- **Resource Management**: Create and manage resources, complete with productivity and cost attributes. Efficiently assign resources to tasks.

- **Temporal Task Constraints**: Handle task temporal constraints such as precedence, fixed start times, and fixed end times.

- **Resource Constraints**: Manage resource availability and allocation.

- **Logical Operations**: Employ first-order logic operations to define relationships between tasks and resource constraints, including and/or/xor/not boolean operators, implications, if/then/else conditions.

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Optimize schedules across multiple objectives.

- **Gantt Chart Visualization**: Visualize schedules effortlessly with Gantt chart rendering, compatible with both matplotlib and plotly libraries.

- **Export Capabilities**: Seamlessly export solutions to JSON format and SMT problems to SMTLIB format.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of model creation, solver execution, and solution analysis, making it a valuable resource for harnessing the full potential of ProcessScheduler.
