Buffer
======

A :class:`Buffer` is an object where tasks can load or unload a finite number of items. A ``Buffer`` can be used to represent a tank, or a temporary buffer of a workshop where manufactured parts are temporarily stored.

A :class:`NonConcurrentBuffer` is a specific buffers where tasks cannot load and/or unload at the same time. In other words, only one task can access the buffer at a given time.
A :class:`NonConcurrentBuffer`` has three main attributes:

1. the :attr:`initial_level`, i.e. the number of items in the buffer for time t=0,
2. the :attr:`lower_bound`, an optional parameter that sets the minimum number of items in the buffer during the schedule. If ever the solver cannot find a solution where the buffer level is always greater than the :attr:`lower_bound`, it will report an *unsatisfiable* problem,
3. the :attr:`upper_bound`, an optional parameter that sets the maximum number of items in the buffer during the schedule (in other words, the buffer capacity). If ever the solver cannot find a solution where the buffer level is always lower than the :attr:`upper_bound`, it will report an *unsatisfiable* problem.

Both :attr:`initial_level`, :attr:`lower_bound` and :attr:`upper_bound` are optional parameters. A :class:`NonConcurrentBuffer` can be created as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    buff1 = ps.NonConcurrentBuffer("Buffer1")
    buff2 = ps.NonConcurrentBuffer("Buffer2", initial_state=10)
    buff3 = ps.NonConcurrentBuffer("Buffer3", lower_bound=0)
    buff4 = ps.NonConcurrentBuffer("Buffer4", upper_bound=20)
    buff5 = ps.NonConcurrentBuffer("Buffer5",
                                   initial_state=3,
                                   lower_bound=0, 
                                   upper_bound=10)

Buffer constraints
------------------
Buffers are loaded/unloaded by tasks. As a consequence, special tasks constraints are used to connect tasks to buffers: :class:`TaskUnloadBuffer` and :class:`TaskLoadBuffer`. Both classes take the task instance, the target buffer, and a :attr:`quantity`. Load/Unload constraints can be created as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    c1 = ps.TaskUnloadBuffer(task_1, buffer, quantity=3)
    c2 = ps.TaskUnloadBuffer(task_2, buffer, quantity=6)
    # etc.

.. note::

    There is no limitation on the number of buffers and/or buffer constraints.

Example
-------
Let's take an example where a task :const:`T1` uses a machine :const:`M1` to manufacture a part (duration time for this task is 4). It takes one part in a :const:`Buffer1` and loads the :const:`Buffer2`.

.. code-block:: python

    machine_1 = ps.Worker('M1')
    task_1 = ps.FixedDurationTask('T1', duration=4)
    task_1.add_required_resource(machine_1)
    # the create buffers
    buffer_1 = ps.NonConcurrentBuffer("Buffer1", initial_state=5)
    buffer_2 = ps.NonConcurrentBuffer("Buffer2", initial_state=0)
    # buffer constraints
    c1 = ps.TaskUnloadBuffer(task_1, buffer_1, quantity=1)
    c2 = ps.TaskLoadBuffer(task_1, buffer_2, quantity=1)

The graphical output shows the Gantt chart and the evolution of the buffer states along the time line.
