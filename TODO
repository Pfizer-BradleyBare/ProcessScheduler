V2 Roadmap
==========
The V2 branch is a reformating of the codebase that results in backward incompatible changes.

[ ] : port to pydantic V2

[ ] : results in a pandas dataframe

[ ] : get rid off context, only use problem

[ ] : clearly separate plots and code

[ ] : define LinearFunction, PolynomialFunction etc. for both costs and productivity

[ ] : JSON importer/exporter for a scheduling problem, based on pydantic should be straitforward
