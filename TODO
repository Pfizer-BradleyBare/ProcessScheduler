V2 Roadmap
==========
The V2 branch is a reformating of the codebase that results in backward incompatible changes.

[X] port to pydantic V2

[X] results to a pandas dataframe

[X] get rid off context, only use problem

[X] clearly separate plots and code

[X] define LinearFunction, PolynomialFunction etc. for costs

[X] use LinearFuncion, PolynomialFunction etc.

[ ] use functions for productivity as well

[WIP] JSON importer/exporter for a scheduling problem, based on pydantic should be straitforward

[X] Move to pytest

[WIP] pyproject.toml

[X] extend tasks constraints (StartSync, EndSync etc.) to a list of n entries rather than 2 entries

[X] Move first order logic to classes that inherit from NamedUIDObject

[X] Objective start latest should take an optional list of tasks as a parameter

[X] Use object (unique) names for object creation

[X] Refactor Indicators and Objectives to get be consistent with other objects

[X] Add more tests for OptimizeResourceUtilization (both Maximize and Minimize)

[X] Add more tests for Objectives start earlieast, latest etc. coverage is not wide enough

[X] in problem, change add_objectve_minimal

[ ] in solver, change parameter "min" and "max" of incremental_solver to "minimize" and "maximize" and match the objective 'kind' parameter

[ ] use the new plotly api to render gantt chart
