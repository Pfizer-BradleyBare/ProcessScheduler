V2 Roadmap
==========
The V2 branch is a reformating of the codebase that results in backward incompatible changes.

[X] port to pydantic V2

[ ] results in a pandas dataframe

[X] get rid off context, only use problem

[ ] clearly separate plots and code

[ ] define LinearFunction, PolynomialFunction etc. for both costs and productivity

[WIP] JSON importer/exporter for a scheduling problem, based on pydantic should be straitforward

[X] Move to pytest

[ ] pyproject.toml

[ ] extend tasks constraints (StartSync, EndSync etc.) to a list of n entries rather than 2 entries

[ ] Move first order logic to classes that inherit from NamedUIDObject

[ ] Objective start latest should take an optional list of tasks as a parameter
