RELEASE NOTES

Version 0.9.4
=============
Bump z3-solver to release 4.12.4.0

Version 0.9.3
=============
Minor bugfix release (notebooks, documentations typos)

Version 0.9.2
=============
New features:
  - export to excel

Misc:
  - documentation update
  - delay solver initialization, better tracking for conflicting constraints
  - explicitly raise an exception is ResourceUnavailable defined before the resource is assigned to the tasks. Fix issue #126
  - raise exception if resource is identified by its name and not the variable name
  - change report status in check_sat
  - fix costs computation
  - fix boolean examples in features notebook
  - move first order logic tests to test_fol.py
  - many typos/cosmetic changes
